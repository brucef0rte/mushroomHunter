Things to do:
figure out how to make game loop
figure out inputs
round 
game currently only has a lost condition.
win conditions: pick 5? w/out poison or psychedlic
    then return to village to share knowledge
    if psychedlic encountered:
        something extra
loss condition:
    0 HP: Death message. Quit or Restart?
add satchel to store non-poisonous non-psychedlic mushrooms found with foraging

things to do later:
some descriptions can hint at properties of mushroom ie if color is stark white isPoison = True
    allows for options of other descriptors: gills, stem shape, volva, annulus
currently 1/8 (i think) chance a mushroom is normal (only if health, poison, trippy all flip false during generation). Would expect opposite.
fiddle with probabilities in general
healthy or poisonous should be binary (either/or, never both)
more generator list options
expand on psychedlic effect
