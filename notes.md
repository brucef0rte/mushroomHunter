Things to do:
figure out how to make game loop
figure out inputs
round 
game currently only has a lost condition.
win conditions: pick 5? 10? w/ out dying
    then return to village to share knowledge
    if psychedlic encountered:
        something extra
loss condition:
    0 HP: Death message. Quit or Restart?

things to do later:
currently 1/8 (i think) chance a mushroom is normal (only if health, poison, trippy all flip false during generation). Would expect opposite.
fiddle with probabilities in general
healthy or poisonous should be binary (either/or, never both)
more generator list options
expand on psychedlic effect
